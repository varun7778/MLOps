# MLOps Pipeline-CICD

## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to automate the entire machine learning app deployment process using MLOps methodologies, TensorFlow for model development, and Docker/Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. 

## About the Dataset:
This dataset contains approximately 25k images of size 150x150 distributed across 6 categories: 'buildings', 'forest', 'glacier', 'mountain', 'sea', and 'street'. The Train, Test, and Prediction data are separated into individual zip files.
